      <description>My journey to Cyber Security started with a BA in Psychology, an AS in Computer Science, and recently starting graduate school in the Fall of 2021. I&amp;rsquo;m currently enrolled in GA Tech&amp;rsquo;s OMSCS program, with an expected graduation date of Fall 2024. My current goal is to work as a Security Engineer. I have a love of taking things apart and seeing how they work, as I&amp;rsquo;m quite curious. My interests include PenTesting, Ethical Hacking, Vulnerability Analysis, Network Security, Physical Pentesting, and Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions.</description>
