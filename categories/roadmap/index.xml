      <description>I created the following roadmap as a visual tool for myself, and as a form of accountability.  With the amount of studying I&amp;rsquo;m currently doing, it&amp;rsquo;s easy for me to forget what I&amp;rsquo;m striving for. Fleshing out this roadmap has already helped me see the bigger picture in my life, as well as serve as a guide for those days where I feel I don&amp;rsquo;t know what to do with myself.</description>
